  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # rules and activating additional ones.

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/icons/medication/
    - assets/icons/settings/
    - assets/icons/settings/customise_home.png
    - assets/data/
    - assets/fake/
    - assets/meal/
    - assets/stool/
    - assets/period/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Kollektif
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Kollektif.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Kollektif-Bold.ttf
          # style: bold
          weight: 700

    - family: TTNorms
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/TTNorms-Bold.otf
        - asset: fonts/TTNorms-Heavy.otf
        - asset: fonts/TTNorms-Light.otf
        - asset: fonts/TTNorms-Medium.otf
        - asset: fonts/TTNorms-Regular.otf
        - asset: fonts/TTNorms-Thin.otf
          style: normal

    - family: LibreBaskerville
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/LibreBaskerville-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/LibreBaskerville-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/LibreBaskerville-Italic.ttf
          style: italic

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
